# lemon bars
This recipe for lemon bars is particularly special to me because it is a go-to dessert for my grandmother, Roslyn, and me. Though we sometimes make it in the summer, some of my most fond memories of the dish are making them right before my grandparents’ annual three hundred plus person New Year’s Day party

## ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar, plus more for dusting
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 6 tablespoons lemon juice
- Grated rind of one lemon

## directions
1. Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit. 
2. Combine 2 cups of flour, powdered sugar, and melted butter. Press into a 9 by 13-inch pan. Bake for 15 minutes. 
3. While the crust is baking, combine eggs, lemon juice, lemon rind, sugar, baking powder, and remaining flour. 
4. Pour egg mixture over crust, and return to oven immediately. Bake for another 30 minutes. 
5. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, let cool. Cut into squares. Enjoy!

This recipe is for a Spanish version of rice pudding which I first made it with my Aunt, MJ. She had pulled the card from her mother’s book of recipes, a set of recipe cards she had purchased after marrying. With no prior cooking experience, and, often, a lack of patience, her mother rarely read through the entire recipe, often changing it on a whim. It was a favorite of MJ and her three sisters. Her father often said “This is okay, but it doesn’t measure up to my grandmother’s rice pudding,” which annoyed her mother to no end. When she first shared the recipe with me, we made two separate batches: the original recipe, using arborio rice, and a modified one, using forbidden rice, soaked overnight. The original recipe was more traditional, with a creamy, soft texture, and the other one, substituting forbidden rice, had a nutty quality. While you can substitute different kinds of rice, you may have to do some experimentation to find which ones work best. In the middle of the night, over half of the pudding mysteriously disappeared. Coincidentally, I disappeared from my bed at the same time. This is an amazing recipe with a sentimental backstory. Enjoy!
